            <h2>CLASH ROYALE</h2>

                <p>Clash Royale is a Finnish mobile game developed by Supercell. It is a real-time strategy card game, 
                    available only on mobile. It was released on Android and iOS on March 2, 2016. This game also features a gacha system where 
                    players can obtain different cards featuring troops, spells, and buildings by spending in-game currency or real money. 
                    It is mainly a multiplayer game, although it is possible to play against AI in training mode.
                    Clash Royale has enjoyed mind-blowing success and popularity globally, with over 3 billion downloads since its launch. 
                    The game has generated over $4 billion in lifetime revenue and regularly tops mobile gaming revenue rankings worldwide.
                </p>
                
                <p>Its success is mainly due to its competitive gameplay, combining real-time strategy and card
                    collection mechanics, as well as its accessible yet deep gameplay and smooth animations.
                    It can also be explained by the fact that it successfully brought competitive esports-style gameplay 
                    to mobile devices, which was considered risky at first, mainly because it was thought that mobile games
                    couldn't sustain serious competitive communities. Regardless, Clash Royale proved the opposite with its huge fame, leading to
                    growing consideration of mobile esports in the gaming industry.
                </p>
                
                <p>The player takes on the role of a commander in the Clash universe. In a fantasy world of 
                   kingdoms and clashes, players build their own deck of cards and compete in real-time battles in various arenas. 
                   They collect and upgrade troops, spells, and buildings across different rarities and types, where the player freely chooses 
                   their strategy and deck composition. Along their journey, they climb through different arenas, 
                   unlock new cards, join clans, and participate in clan wars while mastering strategic gameplay.
