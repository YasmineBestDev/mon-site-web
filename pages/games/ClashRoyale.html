            <h2>✦ CLASH ROYALE ✦</h2>
                <p>Clash Royale is a Finnish mobile game developed by Supercell. It is a real-time strategy card game, available only on mobile. 
                    It was released on Android and iOS on March 2, 2016. This game also features a gacha system where players can obtain different cards 
                    featuring troops, spells, and buildings by spending in-game currency or real money. It is mainly a multiplayer game, although it is possible 
                    to play against AI in training mode. Clash Royale has enjoyed mind-blowing success and popularity 
                    globally, with over 3 billion downloads since its launch. The game has generated over $4 billion in 
                    lifetime revenue and regularly tops mobile gaming revenue rankings worldwide.
                </p>
            

                <p>Its success is mainly due to its competitive gameplay, combining real-time strategy and card collection mechanics, as well as its accessible 
                    yet deep gameplay and smooth animations. It can also be explained by the fact that it successfully brought competitive esports-style gameplay 
                    to mobile devices, which was considered risky at first, mainly because it was thought that mobile games couldn't sustain serious competitive 
                    communities. Regardless, Clash Royale proved the opposite with its huge fame, leading to growing consideration of mobile esports in the gaming industry.

                </p>
                
                <p>The player takes on the role of a commander in the Clash universe. In a fantasy world of kingdoms and clashes, players build their own deck of 
                    cards and compete in real-time battles in various arenas. They collect and upgrade troops, spells, and buildings across different rarities and types, 
                    where the player freely chooses their strategy and deck composition. Along their journey, they climb through different arenas, 
                    unlock new cards, join clans, and participate in clan wars while mastering strategic gameplay.

                        We reached out to the witnesses. From their accounts, it seems their mysterious savior is Xavier, a Deepspace Hunter.
                        Xavier is able to fight monsters called Wanderers with the Player. His Evol type is Light, his primary weapon is a sword, and he often performs light-related sword combo attacks with the Player.

                    <p class="description">
                        The leader of Onychinus is said to have built his empire on illegal Evol weapons and Protocore deals.
                        He's the most influential, dominant figure in the N109 Zone.
                        Sylus is confident and direct. He rarely perceives anyone as a real threat because he is usually the most powerful person in the room. Even in dangerous situations, he remains calm and self-assured.
                        Sylus hates being bored and appears to be a bit of a thrill seeker; preferring to use fast motorcycles, jump out of planes, and use explosives to deal with problems on multiple occasions.

                        Player's childhood friend. He works as a fighter pilot for the Deepspace Aviation Administration.
                        Ever since he went to Aerospace Academy in Skyhaven, he and player don't often see each other.
                        While he loves teasing the player, he's actually quite a reliable person who the player trusts.
                        It is revealed he now works for the Farspace Fleet, serving as its Colonel.
                        He has more secrets than ever before, which causes a rift between him and the player, but he is still determined to do whatever it takes to protect her.
