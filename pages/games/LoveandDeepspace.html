            <h2>✦ LOVE AND DEEPSPACE ✦</h2>
                <p>Love and Deepspace is a Chinese otome game developed by Papergames, also called Infold Games.
                   It is the first 3D otome game ever created, available only on mobile. It was released on Android and iOS on 18 January 2024.
                   This game also features a gacha system where players can obtain different memories of their favorite love interests by spending
                   in-game currency or real money. It is mainly a single-player game, although it is possible to add friends.
                </p>
            

                <p>Love and Deepspace has enjoyed mind-blowing success and popularity in China, given that 60% of the game revenue is provided by chinese players,
                   with a total of 13.64 million downloads.
                   A year and a half after its release, the otome game generated more than 7.5 million dollars, and it already topped the rankings multiple
                   times in the Gacha Revenue Monthly Reports. In fact, it is currently topping the October 2025 ranking with a total profit of 57,750,000 dollars.
                </p>
                
                <p>Its success is mainly due to its immersive gameplay, combining sci-fi and romance, as well as its impressive 3D graphics and animations.
                   It can also be explained by the fact that it is one game among the very few that targets a female audience in the gaming market,
                   which was looked down upon at first, mainly because it is thought that women don't play and spend money on games.
                   Regardless, Love and Deepspace proved the opposite with its huge fame, leading to growing consideration of the weight of the female
                   audience in the gaming industry.</p>
                
                <p>
                   The player takes on the role of a female protagonist that can be customized at the beginning of the game.
                   In the midst of a futuristic world, set in 2048, 14 years after the Chronorift Catastrophe, we follow the story
                   of the protagonist who resides in Linkon City and who is a Deepspace Hunter.
                   She is acquainted with Xavier, Rafayel, Zayne, Sylus and Caleb, who are the five main love interests of the game, where the player
                   freely chooses with whom they want to share unique moments.
                   Along with them, she unravels the mysteries of her existence, her connection with Deepspace, while spending heartfelt moments
                   with the love interests.

                        We reached out to the witnesses. From their accounts, it seems their mysterious savior is Xavier, a Deepspace Hunter.
                        Xavier is able to fight monsters called Wanderers with the Player. His Evol type is Light, his primary weapon is a sword, and he often performs light-related sword combo attacks with the Player.
